/**
 * The Report dimension in our model defines the conditions under
 * which the window contents become visible for further query evaluation
 * and result reporting.
 * SPEs use different reporting strategies.
 * Botan et al. identified four basic reporting strategies.
 * 1. Content change (Rcc): reporting is done for t only if the content has changed since t   1.
 * 2. Window close (Rwc): reporting is done for t only when the active window closes (i.e., |Scope(t)| = !).
 * 3. Non-empty content (Rne): reporting is done for t only if the content at t is not empty.
 * 4. Periodic (Rpr): reporting is done for t only if it is a multiple of x , where x denotes the reporting frequency.
