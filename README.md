OntopStream extension
=====

OntopStream is a research protype extension of the popular Ontology-Based Data Access engine [Ontop](https://ontop-vkg.org), for performing streaming semantical data access of relational data streams coming from heterogeneous data sources (Kafka, Kinesis, Hive, JDBC DBs, filesystems) ingested in Flink as dynamic tables. OntopStream is part of the [__Chimera suite__](https://chimera-suite.github.io/chimera/) project. The interaction between OntopStream and the Flink Stream Processing engine is possible thanks to a custom extension of the third-party [Flink JDBC driver](https://github.com/ververica/flink-jdbc-driver).

The Streaming Virtual Knowledge Graph approach of OntopStream provides a common semantic data access layer that abstracts the specific aspects of the streaming data sources, allowing to completely automate the query translations between RSP-QL and the mapped FlinkSQL streaming relational sources.

Users can perform queries on their local machine using the ___OntopStream-CLI___, or remotely by sending the query requests to the ___OntopStream-Endpoint___ (provided as a docker image). Jupyter notebooks can be used to query the remote endpoint using the [SPARQLWrapper](https://sparqlwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) open-source library. This allows to further analyze the query results in the notebook using the most popular data science libraries.

Ontop
--------------------

Ontop is a Virtual Knowledge Graph system.
It exposes the content of arbitrary relational databases as knowledge graphs. These graphs are virtual, which means that data remains in the data sources instead of being moved to another database.

Ontop translates [SPARQLÂ queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) expressed over the knowledge graphs into SQL queries executed by the relational data sources. It relies on [R2RML mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml/) and can take advantage of lightweight ontologies.

Compiling, packing, etc.
--------------------

__NOTE__: there are available a set of pre-built __[OntopStream distributions](https://github.com/chimera-suite/OntopStream/releases)__. You don't need to compile yourself the code (unless you want to change something...)

The project is a [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) project. Compiling,
running the unit tests, building the release binaries all can be done
using maven.  Currently, we use Maven 3 and Java 11 to build the
project.

Here are briefly detailed the steps for compiling OntopStream:


1. Download and install [JDK-11](http://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/11) or [OpenJDK-11](https://jdk.java.net/archive/)


2. Set the env variable `$JAVA_HOME` to the JDK installation path

```
export JAVA_HOME='<PATH-TO-JDK-FOLDER>'
```
Note: You can use `echo $JAVA_HOME` to check the configuration.


4. Build the release by running

```
./build-release.sh
````
You should see a similar ouput in the terminal (after `$ java -version` and `$ ./mvnw -version` you should see `jdk 11` as version)

```
/usr/bin/java
$ java -version
openjdk version "11.0.12" 2021-07-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.12+7-Ubuntu-0ubuntu3)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.12+7-Ubuntu-0ubuntu3, mixed mode, sharing)

$ ./mvnw -version
Apache Maven 3.6.3 (cecedd343002696d0abb50b32b541b8a6ba2883f)
Maven home: /home/matbelcao/.m2/wrapper/dists/apache-maven-3.6.3-bin/1iopthnavndlasol9gbrbg6bf2/apache-maven-3.6.3
Java version: 11, vendor: Oracle Corporation, runtime: /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-11
Default locale: it_IT, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "linux", version: "5.13.0-21-generic", arch: "amd64", family: "unix"

$ git --version
git version 2.32.0

```
Then, you can check the outputs in the `build/distribution` folder.
